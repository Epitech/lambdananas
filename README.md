### Commit format

When writing a commit, please use the following format :

- A description of less than 80 characters
- Why the changes were made / how were they made (optional)

Please use multi line commits when adding descriptions. 

#### Example of a correct commit:

```
Update system tests script removing build step
    
We should stack build with --exec. That is the
proper way to execute something at the end of a build
else it will get very confused and exit before
finishing.
   
The script is needed because we cannot launch
shelltest within exec for reasons that i don't
quite understand...
```

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Run

### Using stack

- Run `stack build`
- You can run the checker for tests using `stack run -- [arguments]`

### Using make

You can use commands specified by Epitech ($NAME re clean fclean tests_run)

## ðŸ”§ Tests

- Run `stack test` to run all integration and unit tests
- Install `shelltest` and run `shelltest -c test` from the root of the repo to run cli tests
