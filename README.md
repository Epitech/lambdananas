### Commit format

When writing a commit, please use the following format :

- A description of less than 80 characters
- Why the changes were made / how were they made (optional)

Please use multi line commits when adding descriptions. 

#### Example of a correct commit:

```
Update system tests script removing build step
    
We should stack build with --exec. That is the
proper way to execute something at the end of a build
else it will get very confused and exit before
finishing.
   
The script is needed because we cannot launch
shelltest within exec for reasons that i don't
quite understand...
```

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Run

### Using stack

- Run `stack build`
- You can run the checker for tests using `stack run -- [arguments]`

### Using make

You can use commands specified by Epitech ($NAME re clean fclean tests_run)

## ðŸ”§ Tests

- Run `stack test` to run all integration and unit tests
- Install `shelltest` and run `shelltest -c test` from the root of the repo to run cli tests

## ðŸšš Deploy

You should ship a new version of the project when new features or fixes are introduced to the project. 

### Versions

As git recommends, we follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) system for project versions. The last digit in cabal packages is always left empty.

### Procedure

- Update the cabal file version
- Update the `Changelog.md` file (take exemple on the previous logs)
- Make a new commit or merge commits to the main branch
- Be sure the CI passed without errors
- Create a new release draft (releases -> Draft a new release)
- Copy the changelog from your `Changelog.md` file and modify them to be like other release changelogs
- Download the binary artifact from the CI, extract it and upload it to the release (ðŸ›‘ upload the binary and ONLY the binary)
